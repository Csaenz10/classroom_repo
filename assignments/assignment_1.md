  * If the Ubuntu app is not installed, then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings/blob/master/InstallLinuxOnWindows_Automated.pdf)
  
  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can't get Ubuntu running._ After logging in, You are in your home directory. 
  
  * If you are using an Ubuntu terminal that hasn't been setup (you'll know because it will ask you to create a new user name and password) or you notice odd cursor behavior when editing text in the terminal, then run the following code:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings.git
    . ./wlsUBUNTU_settings/updateSettings.bash
    rm -rf wlsUBUNTU_settings
    ```
    
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```
  * It's always a good idea to keep your apps in `Ubuntu` up to date. _The first time you do this, it could take a long time to finish. After that, if you do this when you log in, it should go quickly._
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

  * Consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You will be able to use homebrew to install linux software, such as `tree`, which is used in the slide show.
  
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

## Description of Assignment

Complete the mind expander(s) and the exercise(s) by answering the question(s) in the online form and submitting.  You must be logged into your TAMUCC email account to have your identity attached to your answers. 

The exercises in the online forms closely follow those in the book.  I do make minor modifications and provide tips in the online form.  To ensure that your work is saved, **_I highly recommend that you first record your answers in a text document in either [Notepad++ for Win10](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) or [BBedit for Mac](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and save them to your computer_**.  For an excellently formatted example, see the solutions provided by the book in `~/CSB/unix/solutions`.

* [Exercise 1.10.1 Next Generation Sequencing Data](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8frLNKZngUepylFOslULZlFZdbyVx8RLiPt1GobhHnlUMTVENFg0UjhFTzc3Wkc0NExRTjdLSjdGNi4u)

* **_You can resubmit your answers as neccessary_**

We are also going to flip the classroom again next week. Flipping the classroom means that you work on the material to be covered before we address it in lecture. Then we can spend time in lecture going over the most challenging topics, as identified by you. Then we will continue together in lecture through new material that builds upon this assignment.

Continue working through [**Chapter 1**](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio-2020/classroom_repo/blob/master/text_book_resources/ComputingSkillsforBiologists_Chapter1.pdf), and complete section 1.6, including mind expander 01.04. Note the differences between the book and lecture slides below.

* [CSB Mind Expander 01.04](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8frLNKZngUepylFOslULZlFZdbyVx8RLiPt1GobhHnlURVhQUzBWODVKR0VJTTE2WjlZN05ZTjhMRi4u)

* **_You can resubmit your answers as neccessary_**

## Text Book Vs. Lecture Slides
The [**Lecture_02 Slides**](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/lectures/Lecture02_WelcomeToTheMatrix.pdf) closely follow the book but there is some additional information that is not provided in the book (and vice versa). In the lecture slides, the `code blocks` are represented by green text on a black background, mimicking the terminal.
