## Computer Preparation

You are expected to start each lecture with your terminal window open and ready to go.

<p>

  * If the Ubuntu app is not installed, then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings/blob/master/InstallLinuxOnWindows_Automated.pdf)
  
  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can not get Ubuntu running._ After logging in, You are in your home directory. 
  
  * If you are using an Ubuntu terminal that has not been setup (you will know because it will ask you to create a new user name and password) or you notice odd cursor behavior when editing text in the terminal, then run the following code:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings.git
    . ./wlsUBUNTU_settings/updateSettings.bash
    rm -rf wlsUBUNTU_settings
    ```
    
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

  * It is always a good idea to keep your apps in `Ubuntu` up to date. _The first time you do this, it could take a long time to finish. After that, if you do this when you log in, it should go quickly._
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

  * Open a terminal window
  
  * Consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You will be able to use homebrew to install linux software, such as `tree`, which is used in the slide show.
  
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```
